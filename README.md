=====================

This github repo will serve as a place for me to upload and display various projects that I chose to work on in my free time. 
As for planned projects, I intend to challenge myself learning new languages/programs that seem fun and interesting.

Games
-----
As for right now, I will be trying to make simple games using the [Phaser Framework](http://phaser.io), [SDL 2.0](http://www.libsdl.org/â€Ž)(C++) and Java.


Apps
-----
Most likely a Webapp for guitarists, which shows the fretboard and dynamically displays different types of scales. <br>
Maybe even something like iRealB(?).
